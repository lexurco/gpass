0.6

- Added the -al flags.
- Default dictionary file is now searched in $XDG_DATA_HOME/gpass.dic,
  $HOME/.gpass.dic, /usr/share/gpass.dic and /usr/local/share/gpass.dic
  instead of $PREFIX/share/gpass/eff.long, where $PREFIX is a
  compile-time variable.

0.5

Got rid of config.mk, and the man page is now preprocessed with m4
instead of sed. The program should be much simpler to build and package
now.

0.4

Removed the libsodium dependency.

arc4random(3) is now part of glibc, meaning that the majority of people
should be able to "just compile" gpass without any special libraries,
and the minority could just use libbsd.

0.3.4

Minor maintenance.

0.3.3

- Words can now be separated by any amount of any whitespace.
- Improved the algorithm: offsets of words are now memorised on the
first pass.
- Limited the number of words in the dictionary to 32767.
- Simplified the makefile.
