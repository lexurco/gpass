gpass is a utility to generate secure passphrases. To install run `make',
followed by `make install':

	$ make
	# make install


DEPENDENCIES

Since arc4random(3) was added to glibc, gpass has no external
dependencies on most platforms. Most people, whose libcs don't have
arc4random(3) should be able to link gpass with libbsd instead.
