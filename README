gpass is a utility to generate secure passphrases. To install simply edit
config.mk as necessary and run `make', followed by `make install':

	$ $EDITOR config.mk
	$ make
	# make install


DEPENDENCIES

Since arc4random(3) was added to glibc, gpass has no external
dependencies on most platforms. Most people, whose libcs don't have
arc4random(3) should be able to link gpass with libbsd instead.
